Update 27 Nov 2016: 
* Import textures and apply them to the model imported. 
    * There are a few cases where the textures are applied incorrectly to the model sections.
    * Blender may crash occasionally. This seems to occur more frequently on some graphics cards/processors, and is related to OpenCL.
